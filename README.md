Different modulation schemes, BPSK, QPSK, FSK, QAM (16-64) simulation in an AWGN environment.

## BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying modulation) :
Two phase modulation scheme, where the 0’s and 1’s in a binary message are represented by two different phase states in the carrier signal: θ=0∘ for binary 1 and θ=180∘ for binary 0.

## QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying modulation)  :
Phase modulation technique, in which two information bits (combined as one symbol) are modulated at once, selecting one of the four possible carrier phase shift states.

## FSK (Frequency Shift Keying modulation)  :
Frequency modulation scheme, in which digital information is transmitted through discrete frequency changes of a carrier signal.

## QAM (Quadrature Amplitude Modulation)  :
QAM is a method of combining two amplitude-modulated (AM) signals into a single channel, thereby doubling the effective bandwidth.
